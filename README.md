zvm goes zoom, like "zoom zoom".

# implementation

## gc (gi~~go~~)
zvm currently implements garbage collection with the gi~~go~~ garbage collection strategy.
if you or your program put garbage into zvm, there is now garbage in zvm.
a core tenet of the gi~~go~~ strategy is that garbage does not go out.
unused memory is only reclaimed when zvm turns off.
one day zvm may implement a garbage collection strategy other than gi~~go~~.
